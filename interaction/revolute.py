class RevoluteJoint():
    """
    Class describing a revolute joint between two bodies. 

    In: 
    base_body, mate_body: the two bodies between which the
                          joint is located
    base, mate: the specific connection sites at these bodies
    stiffness: the constraint force stiffness and
    damping: damping parameters

    Out: n/a

    The joint is defined such that a positive joint angle describes 
    a counter clock-wise rotation of the mate body relative to the 
    base body.
