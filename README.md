# RigidBodySystem
Rigid body chain consisting of 3 links accounting for joint angle limits, point contact with the ground.


Connections between links are based on a spring damper model, with limit torques included to avoid joint overextensions. Contact with the ground is simulated using a spring-damper based non-linear stiction model and a standard sliding friction model. Below is a video of this simulation.
